# AI-Driven Clinical Documentation

## Overview
Traditional manual documentation in healthcare is time-intensive, error-prone, and detracts from patient care. This project leverages Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate clinical note-taking, ensuring accurate and structured records. By streamlining documentation, it enhances patient safety, alleviates physician workload, and contributes to research and training.
